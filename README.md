# Final Year Project - Neural Network for Handwritten Digit Classification

#### Donwnload the mnist_train.csv file here => [https://www.kaggle.com/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv?select=mnist_train.csv] and paste it in the project directory. 

## Execution instructions:

### Graphical User Interface for the DigiFY App
- To run the GUI, type the following command into a terminal: python gui.py

### Individual CNNÂ Model 
- To run an individual instance of the CNN model, type the following command into a terminal: python model.py 

### Genetic Algorithm backed CNN  
- To run the genetic algorithm, type the following command into a terminal: python ga.py


#### NOTE: Alternatively, you can execute the files using a dedicated Python IDE (preferably PyCharm)
